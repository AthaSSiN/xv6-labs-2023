  // malloc already has mutex locks but the overlap case is when two inserts happen together, we might have a fork on the head
  struct entry *e = malloc(sizeof(struct entry));
  e->key = key;
  e->value = value;
  e->next = n; // this is the problem
  *p = e; // this is the problem, one of the inserts goes missing
